# Youtube-to-MP4-MP3-Downloader

Overview
YouTube Downloader is a Python-based desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using tkinter. It allows users to download videos or audio from YouTube by providing a URL and selecting the desired format (MP4 or MP3). The application uses yt-dlp for downloading content and FFmpeg for format conversion and merging. Key features include:

Video Title Retrieval: Automatically fetches the video title to name the output file.
Format Selection: Supports downloading videos as MP4 (up to 1080p with AAC audio) or audio as MP3.
Progress Tracking: Displays real-time download progress with a percentage bar and status updates.
Custom Output Folder: Allows users to choose where files are saved.
Cross-Platform: Works on both Windows and macOS with proper setup.
Error Handling: Provides feedback on download failures or missing dependencies.
The application is designed to be bundled into a standalone executable (e.g., using PyInstaller), but it can also be run directly from the source code with the required dependencies installed.

Prerequisites
To run this program, you need the following:

Python 3.6+: The programming language runtime.
FFmpeg: A multimedia framework for converting and merging media files.
yt-dlp: A YouTube downloading tool (fork of youtube-dl with additional features).
pip: Python package manager (typically bundled with Python).
The GUI relies on tkinter, which is included with standard Python installations, so no additional installation is required for it.
